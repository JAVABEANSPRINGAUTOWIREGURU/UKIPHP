UKIPHP - United Kingdom Independence PHP

This project is designed to provide a pure United Kingdom-based PHP implementation, to meet
the increasing demand from British companies for in-house PHP implementations. As access to
international PHP implementations may be affected post-Brexit, we decided to develop this
high performance, pure British, JavaBeans-compliant PHP implementation.
